# Hand-Gesture-Controlled-Virtual-Mouse-Computer-Vision-Project-
This project enhances computer accessibility by allowing cursor control without a mouse or keyboard. Using real-time hand gesture tracking with OpenCV and MediaPipe, the system detects landmarks and maps gestures to cursor movements, demonstrating practical computer vision and human–computer interaction applications.
